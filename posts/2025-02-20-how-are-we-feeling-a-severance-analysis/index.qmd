This analysis was made possible by the [mdr](https://lucymcgowan.github.io/mdr) R package, which used data originally compiled by [the Severance wiki](https://severance.wiki/). Here, we create a little sentiment profile for each episode, binning them in three minute increments and calculating the AFINN average sentiment score in each.

df <- transcripts |>
  mutate(timestamp_seconds = as.numeric(timestamp), 
         bin = floor(timestamp_seconds / 180) * 180) |>
  left_join(episodes, by = c("season", "episode"))

  group_by(id, bin) |>
  summarise(sentiment = mean(value)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bin, y = sentiment, fill = sentiment > 0)) +

    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank())
