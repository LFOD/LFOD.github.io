We have migrated our blog from Hugo to Quarto! Here are a few quick tips that made the transition a bit smoother.

## 1. Setting up a Quarto website

It is super easy to set up a Quarto website. To get the basic template, you can run the following in your terminal:

```{.bash}
quarto create-project mysite --type website
```

You can find lots of details about how to customize your site in the [Quarto Docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). The rest of this post will cover a few things that made the transition smooth for us.

## 2. Moving .Rmd files from Hugo to your new site

In Hugo, my .Rmd files were in the following folder under the main project: `content/post`. These were often individual files, rather than nested in folders. For my Quarto site, I wanted them in a folder called `post` and I wanted each post to have it's only folder with content in a file called `index.qmd` nested within. I wrote a quick R script to help me do this.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(fs)

# pull all .Rmd files from my blog
files_rmd <- list.files(
  "~/livefreeordichotomize/content/post",
  pattern = "*.Rmd")
# remove the .Rmd for the folders
folders <- gsub(".Rmd", "", files_rmd)

# pull again, with full names
full_files <- list.files(
  "~/livefreeordichotomize/content/post",
  pattern = "*.Rmd", 
  full.names = TRUE)


# create folders
dir_create(glue::glue("posts/{folders}"))

# copy the .Rmd files into a new folder, named according to the old file name
purrr::walk2(
  full_files, 
  folders, 
  ~file_copy(.x, glue::glue("posts/{.y}/index.qmd")))
```

## 3. Setting up a 404 pages for readers with old links

Since we have rerouted where many of the files are, I set up a 404 page that will allow readers to quickly find a post if they have an old link. To do this, I created a folder in the top of the project called `404.qmd` containing the following:

```yaml
---
title: Page Not Found
listing:
  contents: posts
  type: table
  sort: "date"
---
```

This will create a searchable table listing of all of the previous posts, allowing readers to quickly find the link they are looking for.

**UPDATE** You can add the old links under an `aliases` parameter in each posts' YAML.


## 4. Comments and Google analytics

It is straightforward to incorporate comments on your blog -- our old site used utterance. Likewise, it is simple to add Google Analytics. To use this in Quarto, we can add the following to the website's global `yaml`: 

```{yaml}
website:
  comments: 
    utterances:
      repo: lfod/lfod.github.io
  google-analytics: "UA------"
```
