I also finally found an excuse to use [emoGG](https://github.com/dill/emoGG).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreq <- httr::GET(url = \"https://itunes.apple.com/search\",\n          query = list(\n            term = \"drunk\",\n            media = \"podcast\",\n            limit = 200\n          ))\n\nitunes <- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(req))$results\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThis resulted in `200` podcasts, which I grouped by month/year released.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nitunes %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(releaseDate),monyear = zoo::as.yearmon(date)) %>%\n  group_by(monyear) %>%\n  summarise(n = n()) %>%\n  mutate(date = zoo::as.Date(monyear)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date,y=n)) +\n    scale_x_date() +\n    emoGG::geom_emoji(emoji=\"1f37a\") + \n    ylab(\"Number of 'Drunk' podcasts released\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**It looks like Roger may be onto something.**\n\nI tried to find the number of podcasts on iTunes by month over the past couple of years to adjust for this, but to no avail. If you have that data, please [send it my way](https://twitter.com/LucyStats), so I can complete this very crucial analysis. In the meantime, I'll pretend it doesn't matter: *While it is certainly true that the number of podcasts in general has absolutely increased over this time period, I would be surprised if the increase is as dramatic as the increase in the number of \"drunk\" podcasts.*\n\nHere is a little shout out to my favorite drunk podcast [Drunk Monk](https://soundcloud.com/drunkmonkpodcast), with the lovely Keiko Agena (Gilmore Girls' Lane herself!).\n\nCheers! üçª\n\n## Update!\n\n[Ethan](https://twitter.com/esjewett) pointed out the curve was looking a little drunk...\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LucyStats\">@LucyStats</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rdpeng\">@rdpeng</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSSDeviations\">@NSSDeviations</a> Wait ‚Ä¶ that curve is starting to wrap around.
