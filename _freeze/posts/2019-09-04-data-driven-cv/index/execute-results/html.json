It usually involves lots of copying and pasting along and then if you decide to tweak some style you may need to repeat the whole process. I decided to switch things up and design my CV so the format is just a wrapper around the underlying data. This post will help you do the same.\"\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n/* I forgot to add color styles for lists which makes them ugly, this is a temporary fix*/\nli {\n  color: #3a4145;\n}\n\ntd, th {\n    padding: 3px;\n    border: 1px solid grey;\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n\nA confession: I always put off updating my CV and Resume. Every time I go to update it, I end up deciding that I don't like the style and then start from scratch. Upon starting over,  I need to manually extract all relevant information for each position and conform it to my new layout. I don't have a long CV yet, but even now, this takes much too long.\n\nA programmer would look at a problem like this and say, \"any scenario where I repeat the same actions I should write a script.\" Since I self-identify as a \"data scientist\" - an unholy mashup of programmer and statistician - I figured I could write a script to do the formatting and store all my information in... spreadsheets! \n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">In a hurry and just want to know how you can build your CV or resume this way? Skip to [here](#want-to-build-your-cv-this-way)</span>\n\nThe goal of this post is to walk you through the techniques I used and help you do the same. \n\nFirst, let's talk about the framework that allows this. \n\n## RMarkdown & Pagedown\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">RMarkdown is just one of a number of tools that allow you to use the [literate programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), invented/popularized by the computer scientist Donald Knuth.</span>\nIf you are familiar with the world of R programming, you will likely have heard of [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). RMarkdown is a file-format/package that takes a standard markdown document and allows the code chunks within to be executed and their outputs recorded. \n\n[Pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io) is a new R package that formats the final output from your Rmarkdown into paginated HTML. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">I had the pleasure of sitting in the very back of a packed conference hall at RStudio::conf 2019 when Yihui Xie introduced Pagedown. You can watch the presentation from a much better vantage point than I had on the [RStudioConf presentations site.](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css)</span> This HTML can then be easily turned into a PDF by using the print function in your browser. Previously, if you wanted to generate a PDF from RMarkdown, you had two options.  You could just print unpaginated HTML (ugly), or you could compile to Latex, which meant you losing out on a lot of niceties that are provided by CSS formatting.  Personally, I know a lot more about formatting with CSS than I do with Latex, so this was a perfect fit for me. \n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">It's beautiful</span>\n![](../../media/nicks_resume_data/pagedown_example.png)\n\n\nIncluded in the Pagedown package is a template called 'Resume.' <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">The result of the un-touched resume template: ![Default pagedown resume example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/49983676-c940a880-ff29-11e8-9487-3b4c94614fcc.png)</span>\nThis template generates a beautiful resume with the main content section on the left and a sidebar for supplementary information on the right.  The main section displays your positions in an elegant timeline format. \n\n\n\nTo add an entry for a position, you write markdown like so...\n\n```\n### PhD.

However, by using the chunk command `results = 'asis'`, we can also generate text that looks the same to pandoc as if we typed it ourselves.  \n\n\nThis means that we can use R to write our document for us. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">I have been doing this for a while with my personal website. My 'projects' section is stored in a JSON file that gets rendered to HTML by some simple R functions.</span>\n The trouble is, how do we write the code do to this?\n\n## Held together by glue\n\nUp until recently, if you wanted to generate long text output with R from multiple variables, you had to use the paste function. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">Technically the <code>sprintf()</code> function was an option as well, but that was just annoying.</span>\nAs its name implies, `paste()` paste's its arguments together into a character string. It's great if you want to join two or so values together, but when you start writing longer, more complicated output, it gets a bit hairy. \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Making a CV/ Resume is something I always put off. But thanks to the {pagedown}, {purrr}, and {glue} packages I can store my positions in lists and build the output programatically. This way I tell myself I&#39;m doing &#39;data-aggregation&#39; and &#39;presentation&#39; for my career. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VDgMAqWmQ8\">pic.twitter.com/VDgMAqWmQ8</a></p>&mdash; Nick Strayer (@NicholasStrayer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer/status/1177258660260544512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThis sticking point was one of the inspirations for the package `glue`, by the brilliant [Jim Hester](https://twitter.com/jimhester_). Glue works by allowing you to write your output string in a natural template format. You tell R where you want each variable placed by writing the variable name wrapped in curly braces in the desired position in your template. Then when `glue()` evaluates, it pastes the values of each variable into its respective curly-braced location.  <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">You can change what character is used to wrap variables with the arguments <code>.open</code> and <code>.close</code>. In case you want a curly brace in your output.</span>\n\nThis means we can write the markdown for a resume position by encoding all the necessary details about the position in variables and passing those variables to `glue()`...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitle <- \"PhD.

For me this consists of `'education'`, `'research_positions'`, `'industry_positions'`, `'data_science_writings'`, etc.. \n\nLast, I needed a way to store the description for the positions. This was a tiny bit tricky as I didn't always want the same number of description bullets. Some positions just get one, some may have three... \n\n\n## Enter `tidyr::pivot_longer()` \n\nTo deal with this, I reached into the shiny new [`tidyr` V1](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/) functions toolbox for the function `pivot_longer`.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🤦\n♀️ this worked much better in my imagination…<br>😬 `tidyr::pivot_longer()`-ing<br>/* for actual good <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> animations, see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grrrck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@grrrck</a>&#39;s tidyexplain repo <a href=\"https://t.co/CL9IEuUlXe\">https://t.co/CL9IEuUlXe</a> */ <a href=\"https://t.co/ohgGXlyCOA\">pic.twitter.com/ohgGXlyCOA</a></p>&mdash; Mara Averick (@dataandme) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1175010415341985793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 20, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nI made multiple columns for description and creatively titled them `description_1`, `description_2`, and `description_3`. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">If I had an entry with four description bullet points, I would have just added a <code>description_4</code>, and so on.</span>I filled in the columns for each entry until all bullets had been pasted and then left the remaining columns empty. \n\nFor the rest of this post, I will use the actual position dataframe that my CV is using to demonstrate, it's loaded currently as `positions`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Helper function to print table without overwhelming output\nprint_head <- function(data, size = 5){\n  head(data, size) %>% \n    knitr::kable()\n}\n\n# Add an id to keep track of each entry\nposition_data <- positions %>% \n  mutate(id = 1:n()) \n\nposition_data %>% \n  select(\n    id, \n    description_1, \n    description_2, \n    description_3 ) %>%\n  print_head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| id|description_1                                                                                                               |description_2                                                                                                |description_3                                                                                |\n|--:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  1|Working on Bayesian network models & interactive visualization platforms                                                    |University Graduate Fellow                                                                                   |NA                                                                                           |\n|  2|Thesis: An agent based model of Diel Vertical Migration patterns of Mysis diluviana                                         |NA                                                                                                           |NA                                                                                           |\n|  3|Independently analyzed and constructed statistical models for large data sets pertaining to carbon decomposition rates.     |NA                                                                                                           |NA                                                                                           |\n|  4|Developed mathematical model to predict the transport of sulfur through the environment with applications in waste cleanup. |NA                                                                                                           |NA                                                                                           |\n|  5|Analyzed and visualized data for CATOS fish tracking project.                                                               |Head of data mining project to establish temporal trends in population densities of Mysis diluviana (Mysis). |Ran project to mathematically model the migration patterns of Mysis (honors thesis project.) |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing `pivot_longer`, I targeted the description columns using `tidyr::starts_with('description')` and transformed each individual position row into a series of rows with each description stored as `'description'` and its value as `'description_num'`.

You write out the column name in your curly braces, and glue runs row-by-row through your tibble, building a string for each. \n\nBefore I could do this, I needed to take care of a few things. One was the dates. Some positions didn't have both start and end date, or they were less than a year-long. In these scenarios, I just wanted to print a single date rather than a range. To do this, I used a `mutate` and an `ifelse` to build a `timeline` column. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# If missing start or start is same as end\n# date, just use end date. otw build range\npositions_w_timeline <- pos_w_descrip_list %>% \n  mutate(\n    timeline = ifelse(\n      is.na(start) | start == end,\n      end,\n      glue('{end} - {start}')\n    )\n  )\n\npositions_w_timeline %>% \n  select(title, timeline) %>% \n  print_head(8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|title                                      |timeline    |\n|:------------------------------------------|:-----------|\n|PhD.

I used `purrr::map_chr` and the `paste` function.\n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">Every time I write a quoted dash character, I always feel like it's a non-plussed face that is judging me: <code>'-'</code></span>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npositions_collapsed_bullets <- positions_w_timeline %>% \n  mutate(\n\t description_bullets = map_chr(\n\t   descriptions, \n\t   ~paste('-', ., collapse = '\\n')),\n  )\n\npositions_collapsed_bullets %>% \n  pull(description_bullets) %>% \n  head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"- Working on Bayesian network models & interactive visualization platforms\\n- University Graduate Fellow\"                 \n[2] \"- Thesis: An agent based model of Diel Vertical Migration patterns of Mysis diluviana\"                                    \n[3] \"- Independently analyzed and constructed statistical models for large data sets pertaining to carbon decomposition rates.\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLast, the template will ignore parts of an entry if it is passed as `'N/A'`. Unfortunately, printing an `na` value in R returns `'na'`, so I used `mutate_all()` to turn every missing value in the dataframe into the string `'N/A'`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npositions_no_na <- positions_collapsed_bullets %>% \n  mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), 'N/A', .))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter all that, we just plop our glue template into `glue_data` and pipe in our newly modified positions dataframe. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npositions_no_na %>% \n  head(2) %>% \n  glue_data(\n   \"### {title}\",\n   \"\\n\\n\",\n   \"{loc}\",\n   \"\\n\\n\",\n   \"{institution}\",\n   \"\\n\\n\",\n   \"{timeline}\", \n   \"\\n\\n\",\n   \"{description_bullets}\",\n   \"\\n\\n\\n\"\n )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n### PhD.

If I end up wanting to change the layout in the future, I just need to rearrange my glue template. \n\n## Building a resume\n\nI used this new-layout flexibility almost immediately. As some people doing hiring may not want - or have time - to scan through multiple pages of a CV, I built a template for a single-page resume. All this took was adding a single column to the spreadsheet that contained a boolean indicating if I wanted the position in my resume or not. \n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">The fact I had an extra curly brace to start {pagedown} in this tweet has caused me large quantities of distress.</span> \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Added a 1 page resume to my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> {{pagedown}-built CV repo. To filter what gets into resume I just modify a column in my positions spreadsheet. No more starting from scratch when I want a new template! <br>gh: <a href=\"https://t.co/NYJNg7daj7\">https://t.co/NYJNg7daj7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/J0JQJz5Xpb\">pic.twitter.com/J0JQJz5Xpb</a></p>&mdash; Nick Strayer (@NicholasStrayer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer/status/1178754342289121280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## Dealing with links\n\nOne of the beautiful things about HTML is that you can interact with it. The most common type of interaction is clicking on links. In my positions, I liberally added links to things for people to click on. This works great when people view my CV on the web, but what if someone wants to print it out and read it in real life?  After all, pagedown is paginated for precisely that purpose. \n\nIn the standard pagedown format, there is a YAML header option (`links-to-footnotes: true`) <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">For all the available options, check out the [excellent docs for pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io/#links).</span> that replaces every link with a footnote and then adds a superscript to the link text guiding the reader to the correct reference. This is a great solution. Unfortunately, the option isn't available for the resume template.  \n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">There is a [pandoc processing function](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/blob/master/inst/resources/lua/uri-to-fn.lua) for parsing links that [is passed to the standard paged format](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/blob/master/R/paged.R#L43) but [is not passed to the Resume template](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/blob/master/R/resume.R#L13-L17). I tried to add it by modifying the Pagedown package itself could never get it to respect the sidebar layout. If I had more time, I would like to fix this at the package-level to make it more elegant.</span>\n\n\nSince I liked the resume template, I decided to roll my own solution. \n\nI wrote a function `sanitize_links()` that takes a chunk of text as input and identifies the markdown links in it with a regular expression. The function then replaces the markdown link with plain text and adds a sequential superscript. Each link it replaces is placed in a bookkeeping array: `links`. At the very end of the document, `links` is printed out as a numbered list. \n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">I just found out you can write comments in your regular expressions, and it makes me very happy.</span>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(stringr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Regex to locate links in text\nfind_link <- regex(\"\n  \\\\[   # Grab opening square bracket\n  .+?   # Find smallest internal text as possible\n  \\\\]   # Closing square bracket\n  \\\\(   # Opening parenthesis\n  .+?   # Link text, again as small as possible\n  \\\\)   # Closing parenthesis\n  \",\n comments = TRUE)\n\n# Function that removes links from text and replaces them with superscripts that are \n# referenced in an end-of-document list. \nsanitize_links <- function(text){\n  str_extract_all(text, find_link) %>% \n    pluck(1) %>% \n    walk(function(link_from_text){\n      title <- link_from_text %>% \n        str_extract('\\\\[.+\\\\]') %>% \n        str_remove_all('\\\\[|\\\\]') \n      \n      link <- link_from_text %>% \n        str_extract('\\\\(.+\\\\)') %>% \n        str_remove_all('\\\\(|\\\\)')\n      \n      # add link to links array\n      links <<- c(links, link)\n      \n      # Build replacement text\n      new_text <- glue('{title}<sup>{length(links)}</sup>')\n      \n      # Replace text\n      text <<- text %>% \n        str_replace(fixed(link_from_text), new_text)\n    })\n  \n  text\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo demonstrate how this works, let's 'sanitize' some sample text with two links in it. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlinks <- c() \ntext_w_links <- \"This is some [text](www.with_links.com). It would be nice if it was just [plain](www.and_without_links.com).\"\n\ntext_wo_links <- text_w_links %>% sanitize_links()\n\ntext_wo_links %>% print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"This is some text<sup>1</sup>. It would be nice if it was just plain<sup>2</sup>.\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlinks %>% print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"www.with_links.com\"        \"www.and_without_links.com\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice the use of the `<<-` assignment for `links` in the function. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">Usually, I am very against mutating variables, especially out of scope, but this seemed like an acceptable use of the technique since its just a static text document and the code isn't running live somewhere.</span>  This is because by default, the `link` array that the function is appending to will only get modified _within_ the function scope, and thus we won't have the output for later. `<<-` lets R know that it should modify the variable reference _outside_ of the current scope. \n\nI wrapped `sanitize_links()` in another function that returns the positions tibble with the links all sanitized in order of their appearance on the page. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Take entire positions section and removes the links \nstrip_links_from_cols <- function(data, cols_to_strip){\n  for(i in 1:nrow(data)){\n    # Remove by position so numbers stay together\n    for(col in cols_to_strip){\n      data[i, col] <- sanitize_links(data[i, col])\n    }\n  }\n  # Give back now sanitized position data\n  data\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI wrapped links in the free text section in `sanitize_links()` so they would get stripped as well. This means that the links sequentially decrease as the page goes down. Is this actually important? Probably not. \n\nNow when I want to generate the CV for printing to PDF, I just flip a boolean `PDF_EXPORT` at the top of the RMD, and all the links are stripped out.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsanitize_links <- function(text){\n  # Only do stuff to text if we're exporting PDF\n  if(PDF_EXPORT){\n    ...\n  }\n  text\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Context-aware content\n\n\nI took advantage of this PDF export value to add a conditional text entry at the top of the document.  This tells readers of the PDF version that there is an HTML version and gives readers of the HTML version a link to download the PDF version. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(PDF_EXPORT){\n  cat(\"View this CV online with links at _nickstrayer.me/cv_\")\n} else {\n  cat(\"[<i class='fas fa-download'></i> Download a PDF of this CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/raw/master/strayer_cv.pdf)\")\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](../../media/nicks_resume_data/custom_messages.png)\n\n\n## Customizing the CSS\n\nPreviously we focused on how to get the positions in, but one of the more compelling aspects of a CV is how you can stand out by making it unique. Because of this, I didn't want to just use the default (but beautiful) resume template; so I modified the CSS using the CSS override option available in RMarkdown. \n\nThis involves just writing your new styles in a `.css` file somewhere in the same directory as your markdown and then referencing it in the YAML header:\n\n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">I left in the original <code>'resume'</code> CSS file so I didn't lose all the niceness it provides and my styles just stack on top of it.</span>\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Nick Strayer's CV\"\noutput:\n  pagedown::html_resume:\n    css: ['css/styles.css', 'resume']\n---\n```\n\nFor instance, I decided to change the fonts to a pair I really love from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)...\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.css .cell-code}\n@import url(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Playfair+Display&display=swap\");\n\n/* Main text is monserrat*/\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Montserrat\", sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 300;\n  line-height: 1.3;\n  color: #444;\n}\n\n/* Give headers playfair font */\nh1,\nh2,\nh3 {\n  font-family: \"Playfair Display\", serif;\n  color: #000;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis blog is not one you're probably reading to get CSS tips, so I will not go into the specifics. <label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">If you are interested in learning more about CSS I really like [Kevin Powell's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw). It transformed the way I view and write CSS for the better.</span> I mainly went in and made the sidebar a bit smaller and changed the way some of the lists were formatted. If you want to see all the CSS I used for my CV check out the [main style file on github](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/blob/master/css/styles.css). The singe-paged resume also has an additional [set of styles](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/blob/master/css/custom_resume.css) that stack on top of both the default style sheet and my CV styles.\n\n\n## Want to build your CV this way?\n\nOkay, we can dispense with the formalities. The quickest and easiest way to build your CV this way is to:\n\n- Copy the files from [my CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv)\n- Replace the positions data with your own data\n- Personalize the text main document text...\n\n### Copy the files\n\nIf you are familiar with git/ github you can fork [the repo](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv), if you just want the files, here's [a link to download a zip of all the files needed](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/archive/master.zip). \n\n![](../../media/nicks_resume_data/layout_of_files.png)\n\n### Replace position data\n\nThe main file you need to change is `positions.csv`. Once you have all your positions in then go into the main `index.Rmd` if you're making a CV or `resume.Rmd` if you're making a resume. \n\nThen fill in your sections. If my sections don't fit your profile (likely) you can add a new section in `positions.csv` (, say `'serious_workthings'`.) You can include this new section by placing the following in the document. \n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">A huge thanks to Mark Scheuerell, who [showed me how to properly render meta-rmarkdown!](https://twitter.com/mark_scheuerell/status/1181271306177613824)</span>\n\n\n````\nSerious Work Things {data-icon=book}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```{r, results = 'asis'}\nposition_data %>% print_section('serious_workthings')\n```\n````\n\n\n\n### Personalize text\n\nLast, change the [personalized text](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/blob/master/index.Rmd#L51-L119) for skills and header text etc..\n\n\n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">I didn't put _everything_ into a spreadsheet.</span>\n\n\n[![](../../media/nicks_resume_data/code_to_change.png)](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/blob/master/index.Rmd#L51-L119)\n\n\n\nFinally, knit your results by pressing 'Knit' at the top of the `.Rmd` in RStudio. \n<label for=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\">Not using RStudio?
