My .csv has two columns: `date` and `domestic_box_office`) and US COVID-19 cases from the [NY Times GitHub repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

We just need to buy more Spider-Man: No Way Home tickets!! Since we're looking at a silly analysis, let's do something horrible, shall we?

It looks like SNL was onto something, but got it backwards! Just kidding. \n\n\nSo *new* claim! a higher Spider-Man: No Way Home domestic box office would lead to *fewer* COVID-19 cases. Let's talk about how we can think about this claim from a *causal* perspective if it was presented as I have done here. There are lots of ways to introduce causal thinking; in my class, one of the first ways I like to get my students thinking about causal assumptions is via Hill's Criteria. These are 9 things to think about when trying to assess whether an association is causal; it is not meant to be a checklist (and the list is not exhaustive!) but I find it is a nice way to dip your toe into causal thinking. \n\n## Strength\n\nThe first criteria is what is the *strength* of the association. Our goofy linear model suggested that 16% of the variability in the number of daily cases in the US could be explained by the Spider-Man: No Way Home domestic box office. Is this strong? The coefficient in our linear model suggests that every $1,000 dollar increase in domestic box office sales results in a *decrease* of 3-4 COVID-19 cases! That sounds pretty strong? I'm not sure this criteria is helping me assess whether this relationship is causal so I'm going to move on to the next one and rate strength as ðŸ¤·.\n\n## Consistency\n\nHave other studies shown a similar association? I'm going to say no...consistency is going to get rated as ðŸ‘Ž.\n\n## Specificity\n\nSpecificity means the exposure of interest (in this case Spider-Man domestic box office) only causes one thing (and that thing is a decrease in COVID-19 cases in this case). I'm going to go with no again. ðŸ‘Ž.\n\n## Temporality\n\nDoes the cause precede the effect? Kind of? It looks like sales are decreasing rapidly from Dec 7th through Dec 20 and cases appear to dramatically increase thereafter? But wait! Could the opposite be true? What if the surge in COVID-19 cases is causing a decrease in box office sales? (Acutally there may be some merit to this, but also we can just look at box office trends and see that they tend to decrease over time since lots of excited people go the first weekend and fewer as time goes on but I DIGRESS!) I'm going to give this a ðŸ¤·.\n\n## Biological gradient\n\nDo we see a dose effect? Indeed we do! As domestic box office decreases, COVID-19 cases increase, so can we infer the opposite, if domestic box office sales were to increase, would we see *fewer* COVID-19 cases? From our little window of data it looks like we can't know (but reality check, if we had started the analysis from the day before, we actually have box office going from 0 to $121,964,712 and we don't see a precipitous drop in COVID-19 cases, so I'm going to give this one a ðŸ‘Ž).\n\n## Plausibility\n\nIs this plausible? No, it's silly. ðŸ‘Ž\n\n## Coherence\n\nIs there a coherent argument to be made? Again, no. ðŸ‘Ž\n\n## Experiment\n\nWas there a randomized trial // some attempt at estimating a causal effect to explore this relationship? Nope. ðŸ‘Ž\n\n## Analogy\n\nIs there strong evidence for a similar exposure (something like Spider-Man box office sales) to cause a similar outcome (a decrease in COVID-19 cases in the US)? Nope. ðŸ‘Ž\n\nOk, so using these criteria, let's assess the overall likelihood of a causal effect:\n\n**Strength** ðŸ¤·  \n**Consistency** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Specificity** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Temporality** ðŸ¤·  \n**Biological gradient** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Plausibility** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Coherence** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Experiment** ðŸ‘Ž  \n**Analogy** ðŸ‘Ž\n\nI'm going to go ahead and rate this one ðŸ‘Ž not likely causal! Sorry! Looks like increasing box office sales of Spider-Man: No Way Home is not likely to get us out of the pandemic.\n",
