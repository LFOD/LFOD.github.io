This paper had a very cool figure - here's how to recreate it in R!\"\n---\n\n\nA [paper by Grein et al. was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016) examining a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir. There are two things that were interesting about this paper:\n\n1. They had a very neat figure that included tons of information about their cohort\n2. The primary statistical analysis was not appropriately done\n\nThis post focuses on the very neat figure! \n\n## Figure 2\n\nFigure 2 in the original paper shows the changes in oxygen-support status from baseline for each of the 53 patients. This figure includes information about:\n\n* The duration of follow up for each individual patient\n* Each patient's oxygen trajectory\n* Each patient's ultimate outcome (death, discharged, censored)\n\nYou can construct a whole dataset from this (and I did!) - you can find it [on my GitHub](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/nejm-grein-reanalysis). \n\n<img src = \"../../media/images/2020-05-21/fig2.png\"></img>\n\nBelow is code to recreate their Figure 2 using #rstats ðŸ˜Ž. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nd <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucyMcGowan/nejm-grein-reanalysis/master/data/data-fig-2.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong_dat <- d %>%\n  pivot_longer(day_1:day_36)\n\ncats <- tibble(\n  value = 1:6,\n  cat = factor(c(\"Ambient air\", \"Low-flow oxygen\", \"High-flow oxygen\", \"NIPPV\", \n                 \"Mechanical ventilation\", \"ECMO\"),\n               levels = c(\"ECMO\", \"Mechanical ventilation\", \"NIPPV\", \n                          \"High-flow oxygen\", \"Low-flow oxygen\", \"Ambient air\"))\n)\nlong_dat %>%\n  left_join(cats, by = \"value\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%\n  mutate(day_oxy = as.numeric(gsub(\"day_\", \"\", name)) - 1,\n         day_oxy = ifelse(day_oxy > 28, 28, day_oxy),\n         day = ifelse(day > 28, 28, day),\n         patient = factor(patient, levels = 53:1),\n         event = ifelse(event == \"censor\", NA, event)\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = patient, y = day_oxy, fill = cat)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = patient, xend = patient,\n                   y = 0, yend = day - 0.5), lty = 3) +\n  geom_tile(width = 0.5) + \n  scale_fill_manual(\"Oxygen support\",\n                    values = c(\"#7D3A2C\", \"#AA3B2F\", \"#D36446\", \"#DEA568\", \n                               \"#F5D280\", \"#FCEEBC\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = patient, y = day - 0.5, shape = event)) +\n  scale_shape_manual(\"Event\", values = c(15, 5),\n                     labels = c(\"Death\", \"Discharge\", \"\")) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = NA), order = 1)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"day\", x = \"\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI definitely applaud the authors for making this so accessible!
